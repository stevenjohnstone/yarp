# Fuzzing

We use fuzzing to test the various entrypoints to the library. The fuzzer we use is [AFL++](https://aflplus.plus). All files related to fuzzing live within the `fuzz` directory, which has the following structure:

```
fuzz
├── corpus
│   ├── parse                 fuzzing corpus for parsing (a symlink to our fixtures)
│   └── regexp                fuzzing corpus for regexp
├── dict                      a AFL++ dictionary containing various tokens
├── docker
│   └── Dockerfile            for building a container with the fuzzer toolchain
├── fuzz.c                    generic entrypoint for fuzzing
├── parse.c                   fuzz handler for parsing
├── parse.sh                  script to run parsing fuzzer
└── tools
    ├── halfempty.sh          script to use Google zero's halfempty minimizer
    ├── halfempty_compare.sh  identifies similar backtraces
    └── triage.sh             automagic triage of crashes
```

## Requirements


> Fuzzing runs inside a Docker container. If Docker is installed on the host platform, then fuzzing should work without installing any other dependencies. Everything required to fuzz and triage crashes is included in the container.

## Usage

There is currently one fuzzing target:
* `pm_parse_success_p`

* **To run the parse fuzzer:**
    In the root directory of this repository run
    ```bash
    # builds and runs fuzzing code in a container
    make fuzz-run 

This command will start a docker container running four fuzzers:
1. a fuzzer using ASAN and cmplog (main)
2. a fuzzer using UBSAN (ubsan)
3. a grammar driven fuzzer (grammar)
4. a fuzzer using ASAN with read instrumentation disabled (noread)

The terminal will have a tmux session running in the container. When the terminal is large enough, all four fuzzers will
display an AFL++ status screen. When the terminal is too small it will show the `main` fuzzer status screen.
The status screen is explained [here](https://aflplus.plus/docs/status_screen/).

Fuzzing output will be generated in the `fuzz/output` directory.

To end a fuzzing job, interrupt with **CTRL+C**.

To delete any fuzzing data, run
```bash
make fuzz-clean
```
> **WARNING**: after running `make fuzz-clean`, no crash triage is possible

## Triaging Crashes and Hangs

From the prism directory where fuzzing is running, run
```bash
make fuzz-triage
```


This will create a `triage/` directory with crashes organized by type. Each leaf directory contains:

1.  A C program (`testcase.c`)
2.  A build script (`build.sh`)
3.  The raw, malformed Ruby program that causes the crash (`input.min`)

For example, the `triage` directory may look like this:


```
triage
├── ABRT
│  	├── 14a9275da317ddd6
│  	│  	├── d0a90c13bfbe209b
│  	│  	│  	├── build.sh
│  	│  	│  	├── input.min
│  	│  	│  	└── testcase.c
│  	│  	└── e4ceb80a0511fe06
│  	│  	 	 ├── build.sh
│  	│  	 	 ├── input.min
│  	│  	 	 └── testcase.c

```
In this case, `ABRT` (abort signal) crashes were found, most likely from a failing program assert.

### Reproducing a Crash

To demonstrate a crash, you can build and run a specific test case:

```bash
# Build the test case
./triage/ABRT/d0a90c13bfbe209b/e4ceb80a0511fe06/build.sh

# Run the test case
./testcase
```

> **NOTE** if you do not have a compiler which support ASAN (clang, gcc) installed on the host, run `make fuzz-debug` to start a container with clang, fuzzing tools etc installed and follow the instructions as above


The output may be something like
```
testcase: src/util/pm_newline_list.c:51: _Bool pm_newline_list_append(pm_newline_list_t *, const uint8_t *): Assertion `list->size == 0 || newline_offset > list->offsets[list->size - 1]' failed.

AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: ABRT nptl/pthread_kill.c:44:76 in __pthread_kill_implementation

Aborted
```
You can then debug the crash using gdb:
```bash
gdb ./testcase
```
To run the test case on **the host plaform** (Linux, WSL and macOS supported)
exit the container
```bash
exit
```
and run
```bash
# Build the test case
./triage/ABRT/d0a90c13bfbe209b/e4ceb80a0511fe06/build.sh

# Run the test case
./testcase
```
just as in the container.



## Crash Similarity

Crashes are deemed to be **similar** if:

  * They are in the same category (e.g., `ABRT`, `SEGV`).
  * Their backtraces have the same hash signature after being stripped of random elements (like memory addresses).

Similar crashes are stored in the output directory under their category and backtrace signature. For example:

```
triage
├── ABRT  <------------------------type of crash
│   ├── 14a9275da317ddd6     <-----backtrace signature
│   │   ├── d0a90c13bfbe209b <-----instance 1
│   │   │   ├── build.sh
│   │   │   ├── input.min
│   │   │   └── testcase.c
│   │   └── e4ceb80a0511fe06 <-----instance 2
│   │       ├── build.sh
│   │       ├── input.min
│   │       └── testcase.c
```

Here, the `ABRT` with signature `14a9275da317ddd6` has two instances. Their backtraces should be similar and likely share the same root cause.

> **A Note on Behavior:**
> When building and running test cases outside the fuzzing framework, crashes may manifest differently. For example, a "use after poison" crash (from data on the heap surrounded by poisoned pages) might become a "global buffer overflow" in the test harness (where data is stored in a global). Either way, the underlying bug is an out-of-bounds read or write.

## Heisenbugs: Out-of-bounds reads

The `triage` directory may contain a `heisenbug` directory. These inputs may only trigger a crash when run by the fuzzer or trigger unreliably outside of it.

This is often due to out-of-bounds reads (e.g., off-by-one errors). The contents of out-of-bounds memory can be random, causing intermittent failures. These inputs are found by a fuzzer job that runs with ASAN read instrumentation disabled, which achieves more coverage by ignoring OOB reads.

The C harness code for heisenbugs is different. It runs the code in a loop, setting the byte *after* the test buffer to every possible value (`0x00` to `0xff`) to try and trigger the bug.

```c
int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    (void) argc;
    (void) argv;

    char *mutation_buffer = malloc(input_len + 1);
    assert(mutation_buffer);
    memcpy(mutation_buffer, input, input_len);

    // try all possible trailing bytes to see if it triggers
    // the bug
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < UINT8_MAX; i++) {
        mutation_buffer[input_len] = (char) i;
        harness((const uint8_t *) mutation_buffer, input_len);
    }

    free(mutation_buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In most cases, this loop should reproduce the crash. If not, enabling the address sanitizer for the C harness code should reveal the underlying out-of-bounds read.
